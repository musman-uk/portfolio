## Ticket‑002: Delayed Push Notifications

- **Opened By:** Customer Support  
- **Date:** 2025‑09‑22  
- **Priority:** Critical  
- **Environment:** Mobile App v2.1 · iOS 17  

**Description:**  
Multiple customers have reported that push notifications for critical account alerts are arriving very late. Examples include password reset codes and payment failure alerts. Notifications are consistently delayed by 10–15 minutes, which makes them unusable for time‑sensitive actions. The issue has been confirmed across several devices and accounts.  

**Impact:**  
Customers are unable to reset their passwords promptly and are missing important account alerts. This is leading to frustration, repeat support calls, and complaints about the reliability of the app. The delays are damaging trust and creating additional workload for the support team.

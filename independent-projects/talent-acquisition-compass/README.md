## 🧭 Talent Acquisition Compass  

## Introduction  
Talent acquisition in technology is often presented as a numbers game. Pipelines, funnels, and metrics dominate the conversation. Yet hiring is not only about filling vacancies. It is about building trust, aligning values, and creating conditions where both candidates and organisations can thrive.  

The **Ethical Compass Dashboard** is a guide that reframes recruitment as a trust‑building journey. It draws on psychology to highlight how fairness, transparency, and alignment influence long‑term outcomes. When candidates are matched to roles that fit their skills, motivations, and values, organisations reduce turnover, avoid burnout, and strengthen commitment.  

This project demonstrates how psychological principles such as person–environment fit, equity theory, and organisational commitment can be applied to hiring practices. It is not a rigid metric. It is a directional tool that helps organisations navigate toward ethical and sustainable outcomes.

### Closing Note  
The **Ethical Compass Dashboard** is not a scorecard. It is a guide that helps organisations orient themselves toward practices that respect candidates and build trust. By applying psychological insight to hiring, organisations can move beyond transactional recruitment and create pathways that support long‑term success.

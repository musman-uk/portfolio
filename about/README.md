 ## ðŸ“– About


My journey into technology has been anything but conventional. It began from a young age when I was fascinated by computers and video games, spending countless hours exploring them. That early curiosity first drew me toward game development, but over time I realised my passion extended to technology as a whole. I would often imagine what it might be like to communicate with computers more directly, and to be part of the wider world of technology. Yet I felt it was out of reach due to inner doubts about my abilities.

Determined to refine myself further, I went on to study Psychology and worked in various settings, experiences that proved valuable in their own right. They taught me lessons about people, systems, and problem solving, broadened my perspective and skills, and instilled discipline and adaptability that I continue to carry forward. With this foundation, and inspired by my motherâ€™s encouragement, I began to overcome those doubts, trust in my abilities, and put my best efforts into finding my path in technology. What once felt like wonder is becoming a craft, and what began as curiosity is growing into a deliberate pursuit.

This portfolio is not meant as a definitive statement or a showcase of perfection, but as a living record of learning, persistence, and dedication. Each project reflects not only technical practice but also a broader engagement with technology, from design and problem solving to communication and intelligent systems. I seek to create work that is transparent and reproducible, with demonstrations paired directly with source material so that it remains accessible and verifiable. In this way, my portfolio is not only a reflection of what I have built, but also of how I think, how I learn, and how I approach challenges.

When it comes to how I work, I value clarity, maintainability, and authenticity. I document not only the outcomes but also the blockers and insights gained, because the process is as meaningful as the result. I also place importance on integrity, by being honest and transparent about the process, and on empathy, by considering how my work could affect those who engage with it.

Technology gives us ways to grow and to connect, and I believe it can be an invaluable tool that encourages and empowers us in our journeys. Whether you are a fellow contributor, a potential collaborator, someone seeking inspiration, or simply passing through, I would like to thank you for taking the time to explore. It really means a lot to me, and I sincerely wish you success and fulfilment in your own journey.

## Log 3: Authentication Timeout  
**Ticket Reference:** [ticket‑003‑IQA](https://github.com/musman-uk/portfolio/blob/main/independent-projects/support-logs/tickets/ticket-3/ticket-003-IQA.md)  
**Reported By:** Internal QA  
**Date Opened:** 2025‑09‑28  
**Date Closed:** 2025‑10‑02  
**Environment:** API Gateway · Staging Cluster  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Resolved  

### Report  
During scheduled load testing, the QA team identified intermittent authentication timeouts when concurrent login attempts exceeded expected thresholds. Approximately 15 to 20 percent of login requests failed to establish a session, returning timeout errors. The failures were reproducible across multiple test runs, indicating a systemic issue rather than isolated anomalies.  

### Steps to Reproduce  
1. Initiate 200 or more concurrent login requests against the staging API Gateway.  
2. Monitor session establishment times.  
3. Observe that a subset of requests fail with timeout errors.  

**Observed:** 15–20 percent of login requests failed under load.  
**Expected:** All login requests should complete within the configured session timeout window, even under high load.  

### Diagnosis  
Investigation revealed that session management thresholds in the API Gateway were not tuned for high concurrency. Load balancer logs showed uneven distribution of requests across nodes, and timeout configurations were set below the expected tolerance for peak load scenarios.  

### Resolution  
- Timeout thresholds were adjusted to align with expected peak concurrency.  
- Load balancing rules were reconfigured to ensure even distribution of requests across nodes.  
- Session management parameters were tuned to handle higher volumes without premature termination.  
- Monitoring was added for authentication latency and failure rates to detect similar issues earlier.  

### Verification  
- Stress tests were repeated with 500 concurrent login requests.  
- All sessions established successfully within the configured timeout window.  
- Monitoring dashboards confirmed stable authentication latency under load.  
- QA validated the fix across multiple test cycles with no recurrence of timeouts.

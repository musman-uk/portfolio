# Ticket‑001: CSV Export Broken

- **Opened By:** Finance Team  
- **Date:** 2025‑09‑14  
- **Priority:** High  
- **Environment:** Web App v3.4 · Windows 11 · Chrome 118  

**Description:**  
During the September month‑end close, Finance staff identified that CSV exports from the reporting dashboard were unusable. The exported files were missing header rows, and several columns were shifted out of alignment. This prevented automated reconciliation scripts from running and forced staff to attempt manual corrections. The issue was reproducible across multiple machines and browsers, suggesting it was not environment‑specific.  

**Impact:**  
The Finance Team is unable to complete month‑end reporting and regulatory submissions on time. Staff are working overtime to manually adjust data, which increases stress and the likelihood of errors. If unresolved, this could result in missed compliance deadlines and reputational risk.

# 🙏 Acknowledgments

This section recognizes the platforms and tools that supported the creation of my portfolio.  
While all code, refactoring, and documentation decisions are my own, these resources provided guidance, structure, and acceleration.

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Copilot** – used as an AI pair programmer and thinking partner to accelerate boilerplate, suggest alternatives, and spark ideas, while ensuring all final code was refactored and documented by me

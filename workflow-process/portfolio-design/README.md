# 🏗️ Portfolio Redesign

---

## 📑 Overview
This process captures the redesign of my portfolio repository. The original structure placed everything at the root, which made it easy to scan but left little sense of hierarchy or rhythm. Visitors could see the files, but not the relationships between them, and there was no clear invitation to explore further.  

The redesign introduces a root level table of contents, a tree diagram, and consistent nested READMEs. Together, these changes create a portfolio that is easier to navigate, more coherent in tone, and more transparent in how it presents itself. The portfolio is no longer just a container for projects, but a reflection of the principles that guide my work.

## 📌 Purpose
The redesign was guided by a set of clear aims:  

- **Orientation for visitors**: to give anyone arriving at the repository an immediate sense of where they are and what they can explore, without needing to guess or scroll aimlessly.  
- **Consistency of tone**: to ensure that each nested README opens with the same voice and structure, so the experience feels unified rather than fragmented.  
- **Balance of minimalism and warmth**: to keep descriptions concise while still using language that invites exploration and engagement.  
- **Transparency of process**: to treat the redesign itself as part of the portfolio, showing that structure and presentation are not hidden scaffolding but part of the work on display.

## 📝 Approach
- Introduced a root level table of contents and tree diagram to give visitors a clear overview  
- Standardised introductions across nested READMEs to maintain consistency of tone  
- Balanced minimalism with warmth by trimming descriptions while maintaining a soft tone  
- Documented the redesign itself as part of the portfolio, showing process as well as outcome  

---

## 🎯 Rationale
- The old layout was flat, leaving visitors without hierarchy or context  
- Categories create rhythm and scale, guiding exploration  
- Consistent tone builds trust and readability across sections  
- Documenting the redesign demonstrates transparency and care in presentation

## 💭 Reflections
Redesigning the portfolio was not only about tidying the layout but also about recognising that structure itself communicates values. A flat list of files suggested utility, but it did not invite exploration or convey the care behind the work. By introducing hierarchy, rhythm, and consistency, the portfolio now speaks more clearly about what it contains and how it should be read. The redesign turned the repository from a simple container into a guided experience, where visitors can follow a clear path and understand the relationships between different parts of the work.  

The process also highlighted the importance of restraint. Removing clutter created space for clarity, and that space allows the more important details to stand out. It reminded me that design is not only about what is added but also about what is left out. Each decision about naming, grouping, and tone was a chance to reinforce professionalism and coherence.  

Working through the redesign deepened my appreciation for consistency. By standardising the introductions across nested READMEs, the portfolio gained a unified voice that builds trust and readability. It showed me that tone is not a superficial detail but a structural element that shapes how the work is received. The redesign also demonstrated that documentation is not a static record but a living part of the portfolio that evolves alongside the work.  

Looking ahead, I see opportunities to refine the structure further, perhaps by adding more visual cues, interactive navigation, or automated indexing. However, even in its current form, the redesign feels closer to the balance I want between professionalism, clarity, and warmth. It demonstrates that presentation is not separate from the work but an integral part of it, and that the way information is organised can be as meaningful as the information itself. The redesign has given me a stronger foundation to build upon, and it has reinforced the idea that structure and content must work together to create a portfolio that is both functional and expressive.

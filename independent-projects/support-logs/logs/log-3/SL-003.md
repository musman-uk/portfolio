## Log 3: Authentication Timeout  
**Ticket Reference:** [ticket‑003‑IQA](https://github.com/musman-uk/portfolio/blob/main/independent-projects/support-logs/tickets/ticket-3/ticket-003-IQA.md)  
**Reported By:** Internal QA  
**Date Opened:** 2025‑09‑28  
**Environment:** API Gateway · Staging Cluster  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Planned  

### Report  
During scheduled load testing, the QA team identified intermittent authentication timeouts when concurrent login attempts exceeded expected thresholds. Approximately 15 to 20 percent of login requests failed to establish a session, returning timeout errors. The failures were reproducible across multiple test runs, indicating a systemic issue rather than isolated anomalies.  

### Steps to Reproduce  
1. Initiate 200 or more concurrent login requests against the staging API Gateway.  
2. Monitor session establishment times.  
3. Observe that a subset of requests fail with timeout errors.  

**Observed:** 15–20 percent of login requests failed under load.  
**Expected:** All login requests should complete within the configured session timeout window, even under high load.  

### Diagnosis  
Preliminary investigation suggests that session management thresholds in the API Gateway are not tuned for high concurrency. Load balancer logs show uneven distribution of requests across nodes, which may be contributing to the failures. Additionally, timeout configurations appear to be set below the expected tolerance for peak load scenarios.  

### Planned Action  
- Conduct targeted stress tests to replicate and measure failure rates under controlled conditions.  
- Review and adjust session management configuration, including timeout thresholds.  
- Validate load balancing behaviour with infrastructure to ensure even distribution of requests.  
- Add monitoring for authentication latency and failure rates to detect similar issues earlier.  

### Impact  
- QA testing cycles are blocked until authentication stability is confirmed.  
- Risk of similar behaviour in production if not addressed before release.  
- Delays in completing regression testing for authentication workflows.

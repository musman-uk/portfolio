# ðŸ“š Documentation Makeover

## Context
This independent project explores how documentation quality shapes the reader experience.  
Through mock examples, I experiment with transforming unclear or incomplete documentation into guides that are approachable, structured, and professional.  

The purpose is not to define universal standards. It is to share my own working framework for what I consider poor, acceptable, and professional documentation. This is a learning exercise as much as it is a demonstration of process and outcome.

## Method
To make the differences visible, I created a simple framework that shows each example at three levels. These are my interpretations, not absolute rules:

- **Poor** â†’ unclear, incomplete, or misleading.  
- **Acceptable** â†’ functional but lacking empathy, structure, or polish.  
- **Professional** â†’ clear, structured, empathetic, and reader friendly.  

The aim is not to judge anyoneâ€™s work, which is why only mock examples are used. The intent is to illustrate how documentation can evolve across a spectrum of quality. Viewers, including myself, are free to assess whether these examples fall short of, meet, or exceed these standards.

## Examples
This project is organised into a small set of examples, each focusing on a different type of documentation.  
Every example contains three versions (Poor â†’ Acceptable â†’ Professional) to highlight progression and trade offs.  

Details and links will be added here later.

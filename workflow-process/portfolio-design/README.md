# 🏗️ Portfolio Redesign

---

## 📑 Overview
This process captures the redesign of my portfolio repository. The original structure placed everything at the root, which made it easy to scan but left little sense of hierarchy or rhythm. Visitors could see the files, but not the relationships between them, and there was no clear invitation to explore further.  

The redesign introduces a root‑level table of contents, a tree diagram, and consistent nested READMEs. Together, these changes create a portfolio that is easier to navigate, more coherent in tone, and more transparent in how it presents itself. The portfolio is no longer just a container for projects, but a reflection of the principles that guide my work.

## 📌 Purpose
The redesign was guided by a set of clear aims:  

- **Orientation for visitors**: to give anyone arriving at the repository an immediate sense of where they are and what they can explore, without needing to guess or scroll aimlessly.  
- **Consistency of tone**: to ensure that each nested README opens with the same voice and structure, so the experience feels unified rather than fragmented.  
- **Balance of minimalism and warmth**: to keep descriptions concise while still using language that invites exploration and engagement.  
- **Transparency of process**: to treat the redesign itself as part of the portfolio, showing that structure and presentation are not hidden scaffolding but part of the work on display.

## 📝 Approach
- Introduced a root‑level table of contents and tree diagram to give visitors a clear overview  
- Standardised introductions across nested READMEs to maintain consistency of tone  
- Balanced minimalism with warmth by trimming descriptions while maintaining a soft tone.  
- Documented the redesign itself as part of the portfolio, showing process as well as outcome  

---

## 🎯 Rationale
- The old layout was flat, leaving visitors without hierarchy or context  
- Categories create rhythm and scale, guiding exploration  
- Consistent tone builds trust and readability across sections  
- Documenting the redesign demonstrates transparency and care in presentation

## 💭 Reflections
Redesigning the portfolio was not just about tidying the layout. It was about recognising that structure itself communicates values. A flat list of files suggested utility, but it did not invite exploration or convey the care behind the work. By introducing hierarchy, rhythm, and consistency, the portfolio now speaks more clearly about what it contains and how it should be read.  

The process also reminded me that absence is as important as presence. Removing clutter created space for clarity, and that space allows the more important details to stand out. The way it has been redesigned leaves room for improvements in the future, but it already feels closer to the balance I want between professionalism, clarity and warmth.

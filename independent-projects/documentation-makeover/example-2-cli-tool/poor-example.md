# CLI Tool

Download the binary for your system and run it from the terminal:

```bash
example-tool run
```

This will start the program. You can also try `example-tool add` to add something to your list. The tool supports other commands, but they are not described here. Most users will find the defaults sufficient. If you see errors, reinstall the binary or check your environment. The tool should work on most platforms without additional configuration. For more advanced usage, explore the available commands by typing `example-tool` and reviewing the output. No further explanation is provided in this guide.

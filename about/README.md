 ## ðŸ“– About


My path into technology has not been conventional, but it began from a young age when I was fascinated by computers and video games, spending countless hours exploring them. That early curiosity first drew me toward game development, but over time I realised that my passion extended to technology as a whole. I would always imagine what it might be like to communicate with computers more directly, and to be part of the wider world of technology, but I felt it would be out of my reach due to inner doubts about my ability. I went on to study Psychology and worked in various settings, experiences that proved valuable in their own right. They taught me lessons about people, systems, and problem solving, and gave me a broader toolkit of skills that I now carry into my work. With this foundation, and inspired by my motherâ€™s encouragement, I began to overcome those inner doubts, trust in my ability, and put my best efforts forward in finding my path in technology. What once felt like wonder is becoming a craft, and what began as curiosity is growing into a deliberate pursuit.

This portfolio is not intended to be a definitive statement or a showcase of perfection. It is a living record of learning, persistence, and dedication. Each project reflects not only technical practice but also a broader engagement with technology, from design and problem solving to communication and intelligent systems. My aim is to make the work transparent and reproducible, with demonstrations paired directly with source material so that it remains accessible and verifiable. In this way, the portfolio is not only a reflection of what I have built, but also of how I think, how I learn, and how I approach challenges.

When it comes to how I work, I value clarity, maintainability, and authenticity. I document not only the outcomes but also the blockers and insights gained, because the process is as meaningful as the result. I also place importance on integrity, by being honest and transparent about the process, and on empathy, by considering how my work could affect those who engage with it. Technology has given me many ways to grow and to connect, and I believe it can be a tool to encourage and empower people in their journeys. Whether you are a fellow contributor, a potential collaborator, someone seeking inspiration, or simply passing through, I hope that something resonates with you in your own path. Thank you for reading. I truly appreciate the time you have taken to look at my portfolio, and I sincerely wish you success and fulfilment in your own journey.

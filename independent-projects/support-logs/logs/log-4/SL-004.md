## Log 4: Rate‑Limit Misconfiguration  
**Ticket Reference:** [ticket‑004‑DTT](https://github.com/musman-uk/portfolio/blob/main/independent-projects/support-logs/tickets/ticket-4/ticket-004-DTT.md)  
**Reported By:** Developer Tools Team  
**Date Opened:** 2025‑10‑01  
**Date Closed:** 2025‑10‑04  
**Environment:** 3rd‑Party API Integration  
**Priority:** Low  
**Status:** Resolved  

### Report  
The Developer Tools Team identified that API requests to a third‑party integration were being throttled earlier than expected. Incorrect header values were being sent, which caused the external service to apply stricter rate limits than documented. The throttling occurred after fewer requests than the provider specifies, resulting in unnecessary delays during integration testing.  

### Steps to Reproduce  
1. Send a batch of requests to the third‑party API using the current integration.  
2. Monitor response headers for rate‑limit values.  
3. Observe throttling after fewer requests than documented by the provider.  

**Observed:** Requests were throttled prematurely, with limits reached after fewer calls than expected.  
**Expected:** Requests should respect the documented rate‑limit thresholds of the third‑party API.  

### Diagnosis  
Header inspection revealed that the integration layer was sending incomplete authentication metadata, which the provider interpreted as a default low‑tier client. This resulted in stricter rate‑limit enforcement. The issue was confirmed by comparing raw request headers against the provider’s documentation.  

### Resolution  
- Header configuration in the integration layer was corrected to include the required metadata.  
- Changes were validated against the provider’s documentation and tested under load.  
- Monitoring was added to track rate‑limit headers and alert when thresholds are reached prematurely.  
- Developer runbooks were updated to include validation steps for third‑party header requirements.  

### Verification  
- Post‑fix testing confirmed that requests now respect the documented rate‑limit thresholds.  
- Monitoring dashboards showed no premature throttling during sustained integration tests.  
- Development teams reported normal feedback loops with no further delays.

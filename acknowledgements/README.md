## 🤝 Acknowledgements  

A space to recognise the resources, tools, and inspirations that have shaped this portfolio, with appreciation and respect, since no portfolio is created in isolation. While I gratefully acknowledge the support that has shaped this portfolio, the work within it has been authored and reviewed by me, and I take full responsibility for it.

### 🔧 Tools  
- **GitHub** – for version control, repository management, and portfolio presentation.  
- **Git servers** – as the backbone of distributed version control and redundancy.  
- **GitHub Codespaces** – for providing a consistent, cloud-based development environment across projects.  
- **GitHub Actions** – for automating workflows such as mirroring the public repository into the private backup repository.  
- **Bash and Git CLI** – for direct control of repository management, running commands such as `git pull`, and troubleshooting.

### 💡 AI Collaborators  
- **Microsoft Copilot** – more than a utility, it has been a collaborator across portfolio projects: accelerating progress, helping draft and refine documentation, shaping structure and flow, sparking ideas, assisting with coding tasks, and strengthening accuracy. Its role has been to extend and elevate my thinking and work, not replace them, and it has served as a genuine partner in process.

### 📡 Hosting & Deployment  
- **GitHub Pages** – for hosting live demos of selected projects, making them accessible directly from the browser.

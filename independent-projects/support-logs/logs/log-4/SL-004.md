## Log 4: Rate‑Limit Misconfiguration  
**Ticket Reference:** [ticket‑004‑DTT](https://github.com/musman-uk/portfolio/blob/main/independent-projects/support-logs/tickets/ticket-4/ticket-004-DTT.md)  
**Reported By:** Developer Tools Team  
**Date Opened:** 2025‑10‑01  
**Environment:** 3rd‑Party API Integration  
**Priority:** Low  
**Status:** Planned  

### Report  
The Developer Tools Team identified that API requests to a third‑party integration are being throttled earlier than expected. Incorrect header values are being sent, which causes the external service to apply stricter rate limits than documented. The throttling occurs after fewer requests than the provider specifies, resulting in unnecessary delays during integration testing.  

### Steps to Reproduce  
1. Send a batch of requests to the third‑party API using the current integration.  
2. Monitor response headers for rate‑limit values.  
3. Observe throttling after fewer requests than documented by the provider.  

**Observed:** Requests are throttled prematurely, with limits reached after fewer calls than expected.  
**Expected:** Requests should respect the documented rate‑limit thresholds of the third‑party API.  

### Diagnosis  
Header inspection revealed that the integration layer is sending incomplete authentication metadata, which the provider interprets as a default low‑tier client. This results in stricter rate‑limit enforcement. The issue was confirmed by comparing raw request headers against the provider’s documentation.  

### Planned Action  
- Correct header configuration in the integration layer to include required metadata.  
- Validate changes against the provider’s documentation and test under load.  
- Add monitoring to track rate‑limit headers and alert when thresholds are reached prematurely.  
- Update developer runbooks to include validation steps for third‑party header requirements.  

### Impact  
- Development teams experience slower feedback loops when testing integrations.  
- No direct impact on production users at this stage.  
- If left unresolved, the misconfiguration could affect future production deployments that rely on this integration.

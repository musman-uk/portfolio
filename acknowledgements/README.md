## 🤝 Acknowledgements  

A space to recognise the resources, platforms, and inspirations that have shaped this work, written with appreciation and respect, as no portfolio is built in isolation. Although I have drawn on supporting tools and influences, the final work has been reviewed and authored by me, and I take full responsibility for its content.

### 🎓 Learning Platforms  
- **Mimo** – for guided projects that helped me practice and apply core programming concepts.  
- **CodeSignal** – for structured assessments and clean code practice challenges.  
- **Programming Hub** – for foundational certifications in IT and programming.

### 🔧 Tools  
- **GitHub** – for version control, repository management, and portfolio presentation.  
- **Git servers** – as the backbone of distributed version control and redundancy.  
- **GitHub Codespaces** – for providing a consistent, cloud-based development environment across projects.  
- **GitHub Actions** – for automating workflows such as mirroring the public repository into the private backup repository.  
- **Bash and Git CLI** – for direct control of repository management, running commands such as `git pull`, and troubleshooting.  
- **GitHub Copilot** – for assistance across GitHub workflows, especially in identifying and resolving errors, suggesting fixes, and helping me move toward practical solutions when issues arose.  
- **OneDrive** – for providing a reliable cloud sync layer outside of GitHub, ensuring an additional backup copy.

### 💡 AI Collaborators  
- **Microsoft Copilot** – more than a utility, it has been a collaborator across portfolio projects: refining documentation and project write‑ups, shaping structure and flow, assisting with coding tasks, and strengthening accuracy. Its role has been to extend my thinking, not replace it, and it has served as a genuine partner in process.

### 📡 Hosting & Deployment  
- **GitHub Pages** – for hosting live demos of selected projects, making them accessible directly from the browser.

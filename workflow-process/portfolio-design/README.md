# Portfolio Redesign

This section documents the redesign of the portfolio itself. It records the reasoning, the choices, and the principles that shaped the new structure.

---

## Purpose

The redesign was not only about appearance but about clarity, consistency, and tone. The portfolio needed to be more than a collection of files. It needed to welcome visitors, guide them with ease, and reflect the values of transparency and humility that shape my work.

## Approach

- **Clarity of navigation**  
  The main README now serves as a true landing page, with a table of contents and a navigation tree that places the root README at the top for consistency.  

- **Consistency of style**  
  Each nested README begins with a short introduction written in the same voice: minimal, warm, and professional. The tone avoids excess but carries a sense of invitation.  

- **Balance of minimalism and warmth**  
  Descriptions were trimmed to essentials, yet written with care so they feel human. Words like *curiosity, practice, growth, recognition* soften the structure without making it indulgent.  

- **Transparency of process**  
  The redesign itself is documented here, showing that structure and presentation are part of the work, not hidden behind it.

## Reflection

The redesign demonstrates that structure is not neutral. The way a portfolio is organised shapes how it is read and understood. By refining tone, navigation, and consistency, the portfolio becomes not only a record of projects but also a reflection of process and principle. It is a reminder that clarity and warmth can coexist, and that design is always iterative.

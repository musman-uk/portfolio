## ðŸ§© Quality Assurance Checkpoint

A focused QA project featuring two intentionally buggy Python scripts.  
This project demonstrates how systematic debugging builds confidence in code by showing the error, the reasoning, and the fix.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Context
Quality assurance is more than catching mistakes. It is about creating trust in the systems we build.  
This project explores how small, intentional bugs can be used to illustrate a clear debugging workflow, from failure trace to resolution.

#### Why It Matters
Quality assurance is not only about fixing errors. It is about documenting the process so others can follow, learn, and trust the outcome.

### ðŸ§ª Method
Two buggy Python scripts were written to simulate common issues:
- A **logic error** such as an off by one loop  
- An **exception handling issue** such as unhandled input  

#### Steps Taken
1. Run the buggy script in a Python terminal  
2. Capture the error trace  
3. Diagnose the root cause  
4. Write a fixed version of the script  
5. Validate the fix with a minimal test  

---

### ðŸ’¬ Exposition
Each example is presented in three parts:
- **Buggy snippet** with inline annotation of the issue  
- **Terminal output** showing the error trace  
- **Fixed version** corrected code and clean output  

#### Example Flow
Bug â†’ Trace â†’ Fix â†’ Test  
This structure makes the debugging process transparent and easy to follow, even for non technical reviewers.

### ðŸŒ… Afterword

Debugging is not only about fixing errors. It is about building confidence in code and documenting the reasoning behind each step.  
This project highlights how a systematic QA approach can turn small failures into opportunities for clarity, trust, and better engineering practice.
Quality assurance is a checkpoint, not an afterthought. It ensures that every piece of code contributes to a reliable and trustworthy system.

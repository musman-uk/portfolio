## Examples

This folder contains buggy and fixed versions of small Python scripts.  
Each example demonstrates a common error and its correction.

- `example_1_loop_error/` → Off‑by‑one loop bug and its fix  
- `example_2_mutable_default/` → Mutable default argument bug and its fix  

See the `tests/` folder for minimal validation scripts that confirm the fixes.

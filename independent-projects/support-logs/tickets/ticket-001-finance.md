## Ticket‑001: CSV Export Broken

- **Opened By:** Finance Team  
- **Date:** 2025‑09‑14

**Description:**  
When exporting CSV files from the reporting dashboard, the output is unusable. The header row is missing, and several columns are shifted out of place. This prevents our reconciliation scripts from running correctly and forces us to manually adjust the files. The issue was first noticed during the September month‑end close and is blocking our ability to complete reporting tasks on time.  

**Impact:**  
This issue is delaying month‑end reporting and regulatory submissions. Staff are working overtime to manually correct data, which increases stress and the risk of errors. If unresolved, this could result in missed deadlines and compliance concerns.

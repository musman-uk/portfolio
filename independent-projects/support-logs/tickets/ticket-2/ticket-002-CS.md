## ticket‑002-CS: Delayed Push Notifications

- **Opened By:** Customer Support  
- **Date:** 2025‑09‑22  
- **Priority:** Critical  
- **Environment:** Mobile App v2.1 · iOS 17  

**Description:**  
Customer Support has received multiple reports that push notifications for critical account alerts are being delivered with significant delays. Examples include password reset codes, payment failure alerts, and security warnings. Notifications are consistently arriving 10–15 minutes late, rendering them ineffective for time‑sensitive actions. The issue has been confirmed across different devices and accounts, indicating a systemic problem rather than isolated user error.  

**Impact:**  
Customers are unable to reset passwords promptly and are missing urgent account alerts. This has led to frustration, repeat support calls, and complaints about the reliability of the app. The delays are eroding user trust and increasing workload for frontline support staff. Given the security implications, this issue is classified as critical and requires immediate resolution.
